**Summary:** This reporsitory contains analysis scripts for spatial transcriptomics data of ovulating mouse ovaries. The flow daigram here describes the experiment workflow used to generate the spatial trasncriptomics datasets.

**Raw data:** All raw sequencing data generated for this study have been deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with GEO series accession number [GSE240271](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE240271). Bead barcode location files matched to spatial transcriptomics datasets have been made publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/madhavmantri/mouse_ovulation/tree/main/barcode_location_files). High-resolution H&E images and a full processed anndata object of all ovary tissues has been made publicly available on figshare (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.6930214). 

**Contents:** This repository contains slide-seq spatial barcode informaiton for spatial RNAseq experiments (barcode_location_files/), meta data files for processed spatial transcriptomes (metadata_csvs/), and jupyter notebook files (notebooks/) required to reproduce the analysis presented in our study.
